    The work I propose is one of the type of a dynamic Web application that combines different areas of expertise in the field of programming such as frontend development, backend, infrastructure and Machine Learning elements trying to be a cornerstone for a platform that could be launched on a large scale. The application allows a user to create a new account or to use an already  existing one. Once logged in, a user can add clothing items by adding an image with them, the garment is automatically classified by a machine learning in one of the existing categories and the user can add various details about it such as size, brand, availability or even a name and a description. The user can see all the items added by him and can create outfits with them through an intuitive system based on grab and drop. All his outfits are visible within the application and he can make further changes to them. If an outfit is no longer to the user's liking, he can delete the outfit and if an article of clothing is modified or deleted, all the outfits that contain it will be updated accordingly.  </p>
